**EDGE COMPUTING**

**Purpose:**

Edge computing processes data closer to where it comes from, like on local devices, routers, or edge servers. This cuts down on latency, saves bandwidth, and helps people make decisions in real time. This is especially important in mission-critical areas like autonomous vehicles, remote surgeries, and industrial control systems, where even small delays can have big effects.

**Usage:**

_In Education_:

Edge computing helps make technology in the classroom more efficient and enjoyable. For example, in smart classrooms, special computers help virtual reality lessons run smoothly without delay, allowing students to enjoy science experiments or virtual trips as if they were really there. These systems will also see what each student needs and immediately adjust the lessons to help everyone learn better. Additionally, if the internet goes down, lessons can still continue without any issues. And, because the data remains close to the school, student privacy is protected.

_In IT_:

Edge computing is changing the landscape of modern technology by enabling real-time data processing close to where the data is generated. This approach significantly improves industrial IoT applications, enabling more effective monitoring and predictive maintenance that minimizes downtime and reduces costs. Furthermore, edge computing enhances cybersecurity by enabling rapid threat detection and response, thereby protecting critical systems. It also optimizes network performance by filtering and processing data locally, resulting in faster data transfer, reduced latency, and improved overall operation.

**Examples:**

_In Education_:

At a high school in Taiwan, ASUS is using special smart classroom tools that allow students to experience science and history lessons through virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). This means students can go on virtual space trips to see planets or conduct simulated chemistry experiments, just like in real life. The computer system within the school quickly manages all images and interactions, so lessons proceed smoothly without delay, even if the internet isn't very fast.

_In IT_:

Siemens uses special computers called edge devices and sensors to help factories run more efficiently. These sensors monitor machines at all times and can determine when something might break. In this way, workers can quickly resolve problems before they worsen. Because of this, machines don't need to stop working for long, saving time and money. Also, only essential information is sent to the main computers, making everything faster and helping the factory run smoothly and cheaply.
